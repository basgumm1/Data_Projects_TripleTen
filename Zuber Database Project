Your task is to find patterns in the available information. You want to understand passenger preferences and the impact of external factors on rides.
Working with a database, you'll analyze data from competitors and test a hypothesis about the impact of weather on ride frequency.

where
    cast(trips.start_ts as date) between '2017-11-15' and '2017-11-16'
group by
    cabs.company_name 
order by
